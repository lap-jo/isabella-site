He was her first

her one true love

but was she his?

Tantrums because he thought

‘She wasn’t doing enough’

Breakups, makeups

Yet they ended up back at square one.

‘Let’s call it quits’

they did.

She was devastated 

We don’t know what he felt

She was down,

almost always.

He came alone

Not her first

Not her one true love

but she was his.

He holds her dearly

reminds her of how

‘She’s enough and always will be’

Yet she still craves

the feeling of the former.

She doesn’t know

how it feels to be seen.

The former says

‘I miss you’

yet her going back

is like the opening of an old wound.

It’s like living through those days again

He does not see her

he’s almost like

an illusion

a constant reminder that

she was never enough.

Yet she still has him

He sees her

but she does not see him

Yet in the end, it’s him

but no her.
